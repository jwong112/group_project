			<h1>COMP1950 - Website Redesign Proposal</h1>
			<h2 class="borderblack">Rationale for the Suggested Changes to the Website</h2>
			
			<p>The current website for COMP1950 has a lot of great content to help students be successful when taking the course. The information 
			on the website is key to the success of the student. We believe that the prime goal for our web-design proposal is to keep it simple 
			and make it easy for the student to find the information they are looking for. Many times, information in previous sessions is needed, 
			but difficult to find again, and our redesign will made it easy for the student to find what they need.</p>
			
			<p>The world of web-design is creative, colorful, and stimulating. We want to bring these factors to the website, so that it is 
			visually pleasing by adding pictures, videos, and other content so that it is interactive as well as informative. We want to 
			showcase the specific skills they will learn on the home page so that students will gain excitement knowing they will be able 
			to do these things once they finish the course.</p>
			
			<p>Students of today use the internet and its resources throughout the day and need the information to be presented in a way 
			that matches the devices they are using. Some students primarily use their smart phone, others an i-pad, and yet other prefer
			a larger screen such as a laptop or desktop. The website needs to work well using all platforms.</p>
			
			<p>When people use a web-site they scan from left to right and thus we will setup pages in a grid fashion to help them easily
			digest the content. We will add pictures, background color, and other visually stimulating effects.</p> 
			
			<p>We have chosen to have a horizontal menu which will remain at the top when the student scroll past the initial image. An
			important addition to the header is a search field. This will help a student find the exact content quickly and easily. 
			The menu is simple to use so that students will not be confused by too many navigation choices.</p>
			
			<p>A key page that we are adding is a links page that will be a central hub for students to find internal and external 
			links that will aid them to be successful in this course.</p>

			<h3>Top 3 Reasons for the Redesign</h3>
			<ol class="lists">
				<li>Incorporate HTML5 and CSS3 to bring the website to current code functionality. See benefits below.</li>
				<li>Allow students to find resources and information on the website quickly to support them as they learn.</li>
				<li>Showcase some of the skills they will learn in the course to increase excitement and enthusiasm for the course.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>Layout and Design Justification</h3>
			<p>Key information improved on all pages are:</p>
			<br />
			<table >
				<tr>
					<th>Improvement</th>
					<th>Description</th> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>HTML5</td>
					<td>HTML5 has added tags to further describe the content on the webpage. The code will be cleaner and 
					describe the content more thoroughly. This allows search engines and screen readers to understand the 
					content of the page. Since there are more tags to describe the content then less generic tags are needed, 
					which will make the CSS3 code more understandable and easier to maintain. With more specific tags it is 
					easier to develop a responsive design to work with various screen sizes.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>CSS3</td>
					<td>Utilizing the Box Model makes it is easier to create a responsive website. We will be implementing
					the “flexbox/grid” functionality so that the website will look good on all sizes of screens. We have added
					additional effects to make the website more visually stimulating.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>JQuery</td>
					<td>We will utilize JQuery to add functionality to the website without needing to create it from scratch using Javascript.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Fonts</td>
					<td>We will use innovative fonts so that the client does not need to have the font installed on their system.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Javascript</td>
					<td>Using Javascript allows the site to become more interactive.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Animations</td>
					<td>Adding animations displays what is possible and also what will be learned in the course</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Search Functionality</td>
					<td>On the menu line we've added a search parameter to help students find key information quickly.</td> 
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<h3>Deliverables</h3>
			<p>Below will show the 3 pages we have created a prototype for. It will also describe what was changed/added and the improvements realized.</p>
			<br />
			<h4>Home Page </h4>
			<table >
				<tr>
					<th>What was Changed or Added?</th>
					<th>Improvements Realized</th> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>The color scheme</td>
					<td>There are more options on colors making the layout more appealing for the users.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>A background in the header of the page</td>
					<td>Working as an entrance banner, a background image was added in the very beginning of the page. The image is related to web development.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>The navigation flowing</td>
					<td>We added a new navigation. When the page is scrolled down the navigation gets fixed when the top of the viewport reached the navigation bar. It also has a new search text field in a form for rapid searches.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Learning outcomes examples</td>
					<td>After informing learning outcomer, we provided some examples of what the student is expect to learn in the course. The examples are good ways to keep the student intested in the course.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Top button</td>
					<td>A fancier anchor tag which works as a top button to take you to the top of the page. This tag uses font-icon which is visually better for the user.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Centralized content</td>
					<td>We aligned the content to be positioned in the middle of viewport with bootstrap. We also applied some media query breakpoints in order to have a good responsive layout.</td> 
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<h4>Lecture Page </h4>
			<table >
				<tr>
					<th>What was Changed or Added?</th>
					<th>Improvements Realized</th> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Main topics with graphics at the top</td>
					<td>Shows the main topics on that lecture in flex boxes, making it more intuitive for students.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Headings for each section with content hidden and expandable when clicked</td>
					<td>Only the headings are shown at the bottom of the page which makes the content easier to browse for the students.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Flex boxes are bookmarked, and opens the content of the specific section with a click</td>
					<td>Each flex box is bookmarked to its specific section, and the content will be shown when clicked.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Fluid and responsive design for smaller devices implemented</td>
					<td>The webpage is fluid and can be browsed with smaller devices. The flex boxes get adjusted depending on the screen size.</td> 
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td>Semantic structure and SEO design</td>
					<td>The website is semantically structured, and SEO techniques such as compound title, meta description, and site load time efficiency were used.</td> 
				</tr>				
			</table>
			
			<h4>Links Page </h4>

					about the information discussed in class</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Most Used Links </td>
					<td>This will contain any links that the students use all the time such as the CSS & HTML validator links.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Code Examples by Lecture– it would be beneficial to have the examples on the website for easy reference </td>
					<td>This will allow the students to easily find examples by lecture and subject area.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Learning Resources - Videos</td>
					<td>This area will have good quality YouTube videos for further learning opportunities.</td> 
				</tr>
				
			</table>
			
			<h4>Additional Proposed Functionality</h4>
			<p>Due to the limit of time to prototype this new website we are including some additional functionality that would be
			really useful to implement after the initial site is implemented</p>
			<table >
				<tr>
					<th>What is proposed??</th>
					<th>Improvements Realized</th> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Add a Wiki</td>
					<td>Some of the most common information can be pulled from the lecture pages and put into a Wiki for quick reference.</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Add bookmark functionality</td>
					<td>Students can have their most visited pages saved for quick reference</td> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Add a database for easier search-ability</td>
